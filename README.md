# A-time-series-based-study-of-seasonal-trends-in-flight-passenger-numbers
Based on the monthly flight passenger data of an international flight from January 1949 to December 1960, this study analyzed and plotted various trend graphs of the data, analyzed the seasonal fluctuations and patterns, and studied the establishment and application of seasonal autoregressive moving average models of different orders.

## Introduction
Based on the number of flight passengers in different periods, reasonable flight schedules can be arranged to effectively save resources and avoid time waste, thereby promoting effective operation in fields such as the world economy and politics. In this project, based on the monthly number of flight passengers from January 1949 to December 1960 for an international airline, we conducted research and analysis, drew multi-aspect trend graphs, analyzed the seasonal variation and regularity, and studied the establishment and application of seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average models of different orders. The results show that the SARIMA(0,1,1)Ã—(1,1,1)_12 model can well describe the variation trend of flight passengers within a year, with an error fluctuation of about 4% within the number range. Under the condition of excluding the influence of other factors, this model can be used to predict future passenger changes effectively.
